### RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research focuses on the state prediction of aerial vehicles under varying environmental and operating conditions, utilizing active sensing-based approaches. The work is situated within the realm of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and performance of aerial vehicles. A key aspect of my research is the development of data-efficient methods to minimize the need for large datasets, thereby improving the practicality and scalability of SHM systems. By advancing prediction models and leveraging cutting-edge sensing technologies, my work contributes to the proactive maintenance and operational efficiency of aerial systems in diverse and challenging conditions.
